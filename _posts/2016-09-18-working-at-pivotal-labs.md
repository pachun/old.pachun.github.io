I've been writing code for fun since the third grade.
I've been doing it for a living since I got my undergraduate degree in in May of
2014.
In December of 2015 I started work as a software engineer at Pivotal Labs'
office in Cambridge.
I resigned late in September of 2016.

# Pairing

Pivotal takes pairing seriously.
Pairing is two people sitting at one machine and working on the same codebase
together.
Engineers at Pivotal do this all day, every day - and it's pretty damn draining.

It's good for productivity, though.
People who don't write code much have a hard time understanding how pairing
isn't inefficient.
It's not.

Pairing helps people new to the codebase get up to speed fast.
Google won't tell you why someone used an actual string of SQL instead of an
`ActiveRecord` query, but your pair will.

When you go down a rabbit hole in desperate search of some solution, your
pair will hold your hand and pull you back up to the surface for air.
It's often more productive than soloing.

Pairing is done well at Pivotal.
Two monitors, mice, and keyboards are attached to a single machine.
The two displays are set to mirror (not extend).
That's how we pair.

While I believe pairing is a valuable tool much of the time, I throw up in my
mouth when I hear people saying things like this around the office:

> _I used to work at a place where we didn't pair full time. I'll never go back.
> I probably won't ever work anywhere else again._

I didn't make that up. It may not be word for word, but that was the gist.
Remember when you were a kid and you'd hide your eyes when movie characters
kissed because you couldn't bear to watch?
That's how I felt hearing people say shit like that.
I'd just pretend not to hear or walk away.

Pairing with other Pivotal engineers is actually pretty great.
However, 95% of your time is spent pairing with client developers because
Pivotal is a consultancy.

Pivotal greenfields your app (for good reason; not many places do what Pivotal does as
well as them), and pair with your developers so that they can learn how we do
it.

Most of the time, though, the developers I paired with were only there because
their boss made them.
They push back hard on my favorite aspect of Pivotal: strict test driven
development.
This results in the majority of your day defending good practices.

# Hours: 9am - 6pm

Pivotal claims to have a good work life balance. They tout it - and it  bothers
me, because I don't feel it's true.

They hire young people and tell them, "yes, we work late, but we get a
whole hour off for lunch and at 6pm sharp, it's pencils down. Go home."
Both of those claims are "_true_", but if you start working there, you will catch a
lot of flak exercising those rights.

At Pivotal, you get your lunch break from 12:30 until 1:30.
Most days, there are meetings during that hour and you're pressured to go.
Pivotal will pay for your lunch if you go to them!

An hour of my time is worth more than a $10 lunch.

If they behaved like it was an option, I'd appreciate it and maybe attend.
One day I actually had one of the managers come up to me and say:

> Nick, I expect you to come to _at least_ one lunch event per week.
> I don't think that's unreasonable, do you?

In my head I went crazy.

Yes.
That's fucking unreasonable.

I'd be more amicable if they behaved like my attendance was my choice.
Yet here she was, _in front of my coworkers_, confronting me for "being
unreasonable".
She should not be a manager.

All I could do was keep myself from saying anything.
I just looked at her in an effort to remain calm.
They may have all seen my anger through the silence, but it was the best
reaction I could muster. _Fuuuuuck_.

Ultimately, I resigned because of a lack of freedom. And because a great
opportunity fell into my lap.

Snobbishly makes fun of people who pair with two computers because they're not
really pairing.

Pivots, we call ourselves.

Hubspotty vibe.

lunch - wont sacrifice an hour of billing for meetings, but want you to give up
an hour of your time and say "free lunch!"

product people don't understand. kitchen chatting. even comments about how it
doesn't feel like they have enough work.
