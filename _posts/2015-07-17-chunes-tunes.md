I'm always listening to music, but I have a problem. When I find stuff I like, I
listen to it on repeat for a long time. I can listen to the same song for days
or weeks. I also have a habit of carrying around a jambox, subjecting others
to that hell.

In particular, my college friends know me for one playlist (~20 songs) which
they call chune's tunes. It's been around since freshman year of school, which
for me was 2010.

In an effort to listen to more, new music, I'm making a new fifty song playlist
every week. Fifty songs per week means I need to find and save ten new songs I
like every workday. I find them using Spotify radio.

I don't hit my goal most weeks and some weeks I don't even try; I run back to an
old playlist. I hope that making these playlists public will help motivate me
to not skip weeks and to make a stronger effort to hit the fify song goal.

As an explanation for the skipped weeks in june and july, [I found a really
great playlist with > 400 songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/kent1337/playlist/6IjDl5eRczFdgZkKYXhuHZ),
which took a couple weeks to digest. The goal was to discover and listen to new
music. Because I technically did that, not all of those weeks were failures. [If
you like any similar music, please share it with me](https://open.spotify.com/user/pachun91).
I like a lot of genres.
