Google Wallet enables you to pair an app with your bank account and then send
money to other people who have wallet accounts through that app.
Square Cash is another app which allows you to send money to other people who
have the Square app.

There's a subtle difference between Square and Google Wallet.

When you send someone money
through Square Cash, the money goes straight from your bank account into theirs.
It may take a day or so, but no extra steps are necessary. It's done as simply
and quickly as you'd expect. I think this makes Square Cash the better
app for most people's purposes.

With Google Wallet, you have an intermediate _Wallet balance_ which starts
out at $0.00. When you send money, Google tries to withdraw the amount from your
Wallet balance. If your Wallet balance has insufficient funds, you can instantly
transfer money from your bank account into the Wallet balance.

When you receive money through Google Wallet, it goes into your Google Wallet
balance. You can forward it to your bank account with an extra couple taps, but
by default, money you receive with Google Wallet instantly goes into your Wallet's
balance.

All transfers _into_ Google Wallet balances are
instantaneous. Google will also ship you a debit card to access your Wallet
balance at no cost.

If you have a Google Wallet account, I can instantly send you money which you
can then immediately spend with a physical card. That's really cool!

Last night I lost the card I regularly use at a bar. I called
around, and I don't think I'll see it again. I cancelled it and ordered a new
one, but that can take up to 14 days to arrive. I remembered I had my Google Wallet
card, and instantly transferred $200 from my bank account to my Wallet balance.

Now I'm just using my Wallet card until my replacement card arrives.
