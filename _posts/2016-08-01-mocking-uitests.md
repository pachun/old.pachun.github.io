[Here's the code for a small application](https://github.com/pachun/inject-dependencies-to-test-drive-swift-apps/tree/e3b9c9f4ee78dfad71a24a75c12d5bb5e4c937bb).

[Here's a gif of what it does](http://i.imgur.com/opT2jnr.gif).

[Here's the only test](https://github.com/pachun/inject-dependencies-to-test-drive-swift-apps/blob/e3b9c9f4ee78dfad71a24a75c12d5bb5e4c937bb/inject-dependencies-to-test-drive-swift-appsUITests/DaysSinceTests.swift).

If you can delete a single line of code from the example app without breaking
that test, I did something wrong. [Please email me](mailto:nick@pachulski.me).
